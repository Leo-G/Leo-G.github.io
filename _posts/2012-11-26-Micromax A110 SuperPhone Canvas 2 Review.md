Hi today I’m going to review the new Micromax A110 SuperPhone Canvas 2.
First let’s have a look at all the features:

Price – Around Rs.10500.
Colours – Black and white (I have the white one)
5 inch LCD touchscreen.
Internal Memory 2GB & External micro SD, up to 32 GB.
8MP Camera with dual-LED flash, auto focus & face detection.

Android OS, v4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich)

Dual-core 1 GHz Processor.
Battery Stand-by Up to 180 hrs & Talk time of 5 hours
Dual Sim & FM radio

So I got this phone a month back because I didn’t want to spend a lot on phones,
Since I have the tendency to loose Mobiles.
Initially I was thinking about getting the Karbonn A21 or the Micromax A100, bit
changed mind at the last minute.
And im very happy with my decision.
Anyways Micromax A110 SuperPhone Canvas 2 comes with the charger which can
be used as a data cable also, and with 3.5 mm jack Earphones in the box.
Its size & function is Similar to that of the Samsung Galaxy Note.

Known Issue – There’s a known battery issue with some of the Micromax A110
SuperPhone Canvas 2 mobiles.
When you’re charging the phone, it takes a lot of time to get charged & the battery
drains off very fast.
So you need to charge it only after your battery drains out completely on its own.
If you do this every time, your battery life will improve overtime.
Mostly it takes about a week.
So now my battery life is fine.

Pros:
Affordable Smart phone with all the best features.
There’s no feature this phone doesn’t have .

Cons:
Has a known issue with Battery but gets resolved within a week.
Delicate & thin back cover.
The Earphones do not have padding & the ears hurt when listening to music for long.
No accessories available or difficulty in getting scratch guard & cover for this as it’s a
newly launched phone,
But I guess it would be available now.

My Verdict – I’m very happy with this phone’s performance at the price I’ve paid and
its compatible with all applications.
