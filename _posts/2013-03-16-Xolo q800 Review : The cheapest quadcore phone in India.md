 

Finally after a long wait, (3 days but still long for someone as impatient as me) I got my xolo q800 quadcore phone.

Xolo q800 Unboxing


Recording +Althea Lobo
Design and usability
 Easy to use , sleak design, comes with a scratch guard as well :)







Memory & CPU

The phone comes packed with  a  mediatek  MT6589  1.2 GHz quad-core processor with PowerVR SGX544 GPU and does not lag one bit. Don't believe me I ll let the Scores do the talking

Xolo q800 antutu Benchmark was right up there at 13354






The Quandrant benchmark puts the phone Just below Asus Tranformer prime.

The 1GB ram lets you have enough memory for games and apps at the same time.
You also get 4GB of internal memory with about 2.7Gb available

CAMERA

An 8 megapixel camera with LED flash, The pics were more than decent even for an average photographer like me :)

Battery life

2100mAh, I am a heavy user , I don't even close apps :), And game all too often. The battery has still not given up on me

So what's the final Verdict, This or the Mircomax a116 ?

I would definitely Go for the Xoloq800, Its cheaper, has the same specs, Performs much better (I heard that Mircomax a116 hangs a lot and is very Buggy) and best of all is in stock :)

Price


It's in stock again  at Flipkart.com so buy it quick before it goes out of stock.
