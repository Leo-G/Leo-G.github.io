My GF and soon to be wife Al wanted a new PC and since her budget was not very big I told her to buy one without Windows installed on it.

Ubuntu 13.10 executable bit

As soon as she got the pc, I set up Ubuntu and gave her a small tour. I chose Ubuntu cause of it's ease of use, friendly UI and low learning curve as compared to other Linux Distros.
Al spent most of her time on Facebook and her blog beautygyaan.com. So I thought what could go wrong right? Wrong!
As soon as she got use to Ubuntu she was downloading all sorts of stuff and clicking on all Ads which had led to other ads and pop ups. That got me a little concerned with the amount of howto's on hacking. But then I realized that it is Linux that Ubuntu runs on and Linux was built with Security in mind. The great part about the Linux is that you cannot execute a file until the executable bit is set. It means that you need to specifically give executive permissions to a file
before you can run it. Hence even if she did download a virus file, it would not be able to run unless you gave it executable permissions. Right click on any file and click on the Permissions tab to view it.

Ubuntu perms

This is one of the best security features of Linux or Ubuntu which makes it safe for anyone to connect to the web and start browsing.

Oh yes, I also gave her a print out of some simple tips to ensure a blissful experience :), Feel free to use it.

IF THE COMPUTER IS NOT WORKING CHECK IF THE POWER IS ON, DO NOT CALL ME.
IF THE INTERNET IS NOT WORKING CHECK IF THE ROUTER IS ON, DO NOT CALL ME.
IF BOTH ARE NOT WORKING THEN CALL TECH SUPPORT, DO NOT CALL ME.

Happy Birthday Ubuntu 13.10
