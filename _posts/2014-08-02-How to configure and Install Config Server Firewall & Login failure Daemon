Whenever I setup a Linux VPS, the first thing I do is install a firewall. I have noticed an increase in attacks on my servers, especially from China. I use
Config Server Firewall (CFG) and Login Failure deamon (LFD) because they are easy to set up and provide additional features like suspicious file reporting and system monitoring.

Installation of Config Server Firewall

Before your proceed, be sure to remove any firewall software already installed.

[leo@linux-vps ~]# wget http://configserver.com/free/csf.tgz
[leo@linux-vps ~]# tar -xzf csf.tgz
[leo@linux-vps ~]# cd csf
[leo@linux-vps ~]# sudo sh install.sh

The script is written in perl,so you will need to check for the required perl modules.

perl /usr/local/csf/bin/csftest.pl

You will get some features are not installed but that's ok as long as you do not get any fatal errors.

Configure CSF 
Modify the configuration to include only ports used by your applications

[leo@linux-vps ~]# sudo vim /etc/csf/csf.conf
# Allow incoming TCP ports
TCP_IN = "22,80"
# Allow outgoing TCP ports
TCP_OUT = "25"
#add your email for alerts
LF_ALERT_TO = "youremail@domain.com"
#Remove from testing mode
TESTING = "0"
Common services and their port numbers

22: ssh
25: postfix
80: http
Start CSF

[leo@linux-vps ~]sudo csf -s
As long as there are no fatal config errors you can ignore the below warning.

WARNING* RESTRICT_SYSLOG is disabled. See SECURITY WARNING in /etc/csf/csf.conf
CSF config files through which you can allow and deny IP addresses

csf.allow       - a list of IP's and CIDR addresses that should always be allowed
                  through the firewall
csf.deny        - a list of IP's and CIDR addresses that should never be allowed
                  through the firewall
csf.ignore      - a list of IP's and CIDR addresses that lfd should ignore and not
                  not block if detected

The difference between "csf.allow" and "csf.ignore" is that "csf.allow" rules overwrite "csf.deny".

You may want to whitelist your IP address by adding it to "/etc/csf/csf.allow"

You can also whitelist processes and users by modifying "/etc/csf/csf.pignore" as follows

exe:/usr/sbin/nginx
user:leo
You need to restart CSF for the changes to reflect

[leo@linux-vps ~]sudo csf -r
CSF commands to start, stop and disable csf

h,  --help
              Show this message
-l, --status
 List/Show the IPv4 iptables configuration
-l6, --status6
 List/Show the IPv6 ip6tables configuration
-s, --start
 Start the firewall rules
-f, --stop
 Flush/Stop firewall rules (Note: lfd may restart csf)
-r, --restart
 Restart firewall rules
 -x, disable
 
 -e, enable
Uninstalling CSF is simple as well.

sh /etc/csf/uninstall.sh
